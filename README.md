## Workflow 
![Design and Approach](<public/workflow.jpg>) 


## Getting Started

Here are some instructions to make your own copy of Codeboost and get started with it locally.

### Prerequisites

  ```sh
  npm install npm@latest -g
  ```

### Installation

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/shambhavipaygude/codeboost
   ```
2. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. Make `.env` file and add your API credentials in it.
   ```js
   API_KEY = 'ENTER YOUR API KEY';
   ```
4. Change git remote url to avoid accidental pushes to base project
   ```sh
   git remote set-url origin https://github.com/shambhavipaygude/codeboost
   git remote -v # confirm the changes
   ```


## Usage

## Current Limitations
Due to continuous large number of API calls for auto-completion and suggestion of possible bugs, resource might get exhausted.
